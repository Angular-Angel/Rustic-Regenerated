Rustic Regenerated

A port of CadaverousEris's mod [Rustic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rustic) from Minecraft 1.12, to 1.17, with some changes. Adds apple trees, 2*2 oak and birch trees, new biomes, stakes, crossed logs, and a recipe for rooted dirt.

Special Thanks:
CadaverousEris for letting me port their project and use their assets.
EpicNecromancer for modelling help
Commoble for help with lots and lots of code
Aestate Cactus for help with configs.
They made all of this much, much easier.
